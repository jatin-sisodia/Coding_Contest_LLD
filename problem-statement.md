Introduction to QContest
QContest is an online coding platform that allows a user to sign up, create contests and participate in contests hosted by other registered users..
Each contest must have a level of difficulty (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) and will contain a set of unique questions ( Same question cannot be a part of more than one contest ).
Each question will have different levels of difficulty (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) and score.
Based on the contest level, the question set is going to be decided. Contest level with LOW difficulty will have questions with LOW difficulty level.
Final score will be decided based on the difficulty LEVEL chosen for a contest and the number of questions.
Users solve problems and get points based on the difficulty of the problems and after the contest, scores of the users are updated.
